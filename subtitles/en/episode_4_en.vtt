00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.240
SUNSET
Love comes at Night

3
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.360
Dad!
Dad, quick!

4
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.840
Dad! Dad!

5
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.960
What's wrong, what happened?

6
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.360
It's the cherry trees Dad,
they're burning.

7
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
- Burning? The cherries?
- Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

8
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.080
But how is that possible?
I installed a fire alarm myself.

9
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.080
That doesn't matter now, dad.

10
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.280
Quick, bring buckets,
blankets and the camera,

11
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.000
that place is pretty at night.
- Okay, let's go!

12
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.599
Here, take the blankets.

13
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.880
I'll bring the buckets.

14
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.880
Let's go,
we cannot waste any time.

15
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.200
I mean, maybe for putting on
some trousers, the TV might be there.

16
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680
You're crazy,
can't you see this is a disaster?

17
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.200
Let's go!

18
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.160
Hurry up, let's go!

19
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.640
Sebastião,
João ran out of water, go help him!

20
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240
We are out of water, boss.

21
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.800
Go to the warehouse
and bring some reeds.

22
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.000
Use everything you can,
everything!

23
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.960
My God. It's like watching our life
going up in flames.

24
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.520
But how could this have happened?
The cherry trees have a fire alarm.

25
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.720
I saw António installing them
in every tree.

26
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.600
Quicker, damn it!
Quicker!

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.000
There are no more buckets, sir.

28
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.960
Take the truck
and go to a Chinese store.

29
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.640
Right now, boss? It's 4 am
and I don't like to drive at night.

30
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.640
Go, man, go!

31
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.040
Joaquim, stop smoking
and go help your son, who's on fire.

32
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.400
Put Nuno out!

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.280
Who in the hell comes to a fire
with a feather jacket?

34
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.320
That's it, burn.
Burn everything.

35
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.880
Damn,
it got stuck in my throat.

36
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640
António!

37
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.480
- Jesus Christ.
- António!

38
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.960
We are lost.

39
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.320
Lance corporal,
they set the shrimp on fire!

40
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.520
Lance corporal, sir!
Antunes! Someone!

41
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.120
Tito Paris Command.
This is C4Pedro station.

42
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.800
I am requesting a bombardment

43
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.240
in the coordinates
Echo, Parrot, Salamander, Adele,

44
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.640
Moss, Celine.
I repeat:

45
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.800
Echo, Hart, McGraw,
Lassie, Netflix...

46
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.320
Charlie, Bravo,

47
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.440
Madonna, T-Mobile...
- Dad!

48
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.200
António, react, man!

49
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.160
- React, man!
- I am sorry, boss.

50
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.920
I will take care of this.
Don't worry.

51
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.080
I know how to guide these men.

52
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.000
My life won't be ruined
by another fire.

53
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.120
You there, attention, everyone!

54
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.440
Three groups.
The first throws water.

55
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.840
The others fill the buckets.

56
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.720
Agostinho,
build an anti-fire barrier with the goats.

57
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.240
Alves, you go and order pizzas
for everyone,

58
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.480
we will be here all night.

59
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.160
How did it go?

60
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.640
Half the cherry trees were saved,
thank God.

61
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.320
Thank God and António.

62
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.880
If it wasn't for him, ordering the men
and handing out pizzas,

63
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.160
I don't know what would've happened
to the estate.

64
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.640
- Thank you, António.
- Thank you, boss.

65
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.840
I just did my job.

66
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.680
And if only you had warned me
sooner,

67
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.840
maybe I could have saved
Alcino's son's moustache.

68
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960
That's right.

69
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.200
It will grow back,
by the grace of the Lord.

70
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Everybody was a hero.
All but uncle, who I didn't see...

71
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.320
That's true.
Where were you, Simão?

72
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.640
Me? I was in a Latin dance
online course.

73
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.400
- At 2 am?
- It's the time zone.

74
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.160
Miss Sapatón lives in Caracas.

75
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.440
Funny how you are never there when
something bad happens at the estate.

76
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.120
Have you thought
that maybe things go wrong

77
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.120
precisely because I am not around,
Eduardo?

78
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.080
Are you insinuating that I am
not managing the estate well?

79
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.560
The air belongs to everyone...

80
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.320
You are a crook,
you have always been a crook!

81
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.800
You will pay for...
You will pay for this, Eduardo.

82
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.720
Mark my words:
You will pay for this.

83
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.680
- Is everything okay, boss?
- Dad?

84
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.920
No, everything's okay.

85
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.680
It was probably the lamprey,
it's not in season...

86
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.520
- Dad!
- Boss!

87
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.960
- Eduardo!
- Boss, what's wrong?

88
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.800
Maria da Piedade, call 911!

89
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.760
Warm up a pot of water

90
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.760
and bring fresh towels.
- Isn't that for giving birth?

91
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.480
Just do what I say, woman.
Go on!

92
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.920
Sir, come on.

93
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.040
- Dad!
- Come on!

94
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.400
Dad!

95
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.680
- ... and when I got there, it was closed.
- Right...

96
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.600
Because I had to go
to the supermarket

97
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.360
and to the doctor to see
if my son's cyst was malignant.

98
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.120
I see...

99
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.080
But I don't care.

100
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.480
What's more important:
my sushi or your son's cyst?

101
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.120
- But it could've been malignant...
- Shut up! Get out.

102
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.480
Carla, what's wrong?

103
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.800
I hate women who go to
the supermarket. Leave her.

104
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.160
That's all she does:
cry and staple invoices.

105
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.160
You cannot treat the girl like that.
She lives in Massamá.

106
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.960
Tell me.

107
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.760
Remember the lab
specialising in orphan's DNA,

108
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.880
in Benedita?

109
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.520
- They just faxed me.
- A fax?

110
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.360
- It's in Benedita...
- And what did they find out?

111
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.760
Filipa...
You have a twin sister.

112
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.800
A twin sister?

113
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.720
What's up, Vera?
Have you seen it?

114
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.000
Yeah.
The story with our rehearsal

115
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.640
is being seen everywhere.
Even Marques Mendes shared it.

116
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.400
I will smoke a joint to celebrate.

117
00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.360
- Come on, man.
- What?

118
00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:40.400
- What was our agreement?
- Was it my turn to bring ramen?

119
00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.280
- No, that you would stop it.
- What's the deal with you?

120
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.800
I'm not an addict,
I can stop whenever I want.

121
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.600
- So stop now.
- Are you serious? On a Friday?

122
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.800
- What's up, people?
- Have you heard, Jimmy?

123
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.520
Yes. Damn...

124
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.840
Greta Thurnberg's
having a baby with Zé Fidalgo.

125
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.680
No, man. Our story.

126
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.480
- Haven't you seen it?
- No, I don't have mobile data.

127
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.080
- I'm getting poorer by the day.
- We are a success on social media!

128
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.520
Even Graça Freitas shared it.

129
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.320
Man, you have to find a job.
You can't live like this.

130
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.560
You think it's easy for a vegan
to find work?

131
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.640
There's lots of discrimination.
They ask right away.

132
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.040
- Can't you lie?
- You think?

133
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.520
The dudes are not stupid.
The first thing they do

134
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.320
is to put meat in front of you.
- Think positive.

135
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.440
If our band succeeds, maybe
none of us will have to work again,

136
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.600
like those youtubers, and stuff,
but with normal hair.

137
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.600
- Yes, that'd be neat!
- I'll call Lourenço to ask if he saw it.

138
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.800
Everything's an excuse
to call Lourenço...

139
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.560
Dudes, leave me alone.
Get off my back.

140
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.080
Sunset
Sunset

141
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.560
Sunset

142
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.000
Sunset
Sunset

143
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.000
Sunset

144
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.880
Sunset

145
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.600
Sunset

146
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.640
Easy, easy.

147
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.520
Put me down there.

148
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.240
Here, here.

149
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.880
- I will warn your dad.
- No! Don't tell him, Narciso.

150
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.800
I'm fine,
I don't want to worry him.

151
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.800
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm used to burns.

152
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.480
- I weld with my shirt off.
- A glass of milk?

153
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.600
No, nothing.
Go on, you can go.

154
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.000
As you wish, boy.

155
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.800
Hello?
Vera?

156
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.080
What?
The story that Matilde filmed

157
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.600
of our rehearsal went viral
and is being shared

158
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.120
and Graça Freitas liked it?

159
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.120
- Let me call you back.
- Lourenço!

160
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.040
- I'll call you back.
- Son!

161
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.160
What happened, son?

162
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640
I...

163
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.160
I was trying to put out a fire,

164
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.840
a cherry slipped inside my shirt
and set me on fire.

165
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.120
- That's awful.
- I'll get toothpaste and after-sun cream.

166
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.040
My God...
I was so worried, Lourenço...

167
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.840
Matilde,
I think I owe you an apology.

168
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.600
I'm sorry?
I didn't hear.

169
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.560
I owe you an apology.

170
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.360
- Idiot, what a scare.
- I caught you watching porn?

171
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.400
No, it's a Spanish website
with products for bacterial vaginosis.

172
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.960
They cost a fortune here.

173
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.840
Here.
You like it full, yes?

174
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.120
How do you know that?

175
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.440
What's wrong with Filipa, Raul?

176
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.960
She's weird. She left early,
she ordered a mille-feuille...

177
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.080
She heard tough news.
She found out she has a twin sister.

178
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.280
- Why does she treat me so badly?
- You have to cut her some slack.

179
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.000
Filipa had a difficult past.

180
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.560
She was brought up at a nunnery,
had early dandruff,

181
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.920
exchange student in Cacém...
Real trauma.

182
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.200
There are more people
with traumatic lives, Raul.

183
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.080
Carla...

184
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.120
- Where are you going?
- I have to rinse my mouth with elixir,

185
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.040
because I smoke a lot at night,
when I'm watching the game show.

186
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.160
- Carla, do you have plans for tonight?
- Disinfecting the balcony. Why?

187
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.880
My stepdad is making dinner
to celebrate something and...

188
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.840
I would like you
to come dine with us.

189
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.520
So, Ramalho, is your
stepdaughter 18 already?

190
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.920
Better get ready, because she's
like an airplane with two airbags...

191
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.720
Look who he is, this trickster!

192
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.680
Are you out or on bail?

193
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.720
Now don't try to send
pictures of your carrot

194
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.520
to your sister-in-law.
Felt!

195
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.120
- Tó Mané, give me 20 Euros.
- As if.

196
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.120
Don't you have classes, half pint?

197
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.520
I skipped to look at babes
at the mall.

198
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.240
Then I will give you 5.

199
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.520
If you're going to look at babes...

200
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.000
There you go,
today's a happy day.

201
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.160
- Weasel...
- Go on. Pretending to be big...

202
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.760
You're a weasel!

203
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.880
Weasel!

204
00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.280
Blessed afternoon,
working class!

205
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.600
I thought the Chinese
might've given me a...

206
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.640
- Nando...
- Tó Mané, did you fall off the bed?

207
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.160
Shut up, fado singer.
Go trick brits.

208
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.040
Serafim, how's it going?
All ready for today's dinner?

209
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.120
Are the lobsters sweating
or are they still warming up?

210
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.200
For you it's lupine beans without salt.

211
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.640
- And there's no more money.
- Look at this one.

212
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.120
Did you wake up in a mood?
Have I ever failed to pay?

213
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.440
No, I did.

214
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.320
Everyone knows that
if you paid Serafim your dues,

215
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.760
the man would have money
to get two hotties.

216
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.000
This one, with two?

217
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.440
No way.
Not even with Viagra.

218
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.560
You'll allow this?

219
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.200
Don't worry,
the start engine is brand new.

220
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.040
It even drives on the second shift.

221
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.760
Or you think so,
but you're going on reverse.

222
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880
That's enough.

223
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.520
He'll check it with the mechanic.

224
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.400
Add one more seat,
Raul is bringing a friend.

225
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.640
But don't cut down on the plates,
today is a feast.

226
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.080
But did you secretly win the lottery?
What's the dinner for anyway?

227
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.000
Don't try to know more than me.

228
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.240
And you, hurry up,
we'll be here by 7 pm.

229
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.760
- Goodbye.
- See you.

230
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.160
Tó Mané.

231
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.680
New stuff.

232
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.400
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- No, it's just a Lego piece on the bum.

233
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.000
Your dad left
with a bad look on his face.

234
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.800
You know he doesn't like
seeing us together.

235
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080
I know.

236
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.440
But forget about him.

237
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.600
I am sorry, Matilde.

238
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.720
I shouldn't have reacted
the way I did.

239
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.640
I forgive you, Lourenço.
I'll forgive you anything.

240
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.840
I know you meant well
with the stories,

241
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.200
And it was good for the band.

242
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.680
Promise me
we will never fight again.

243
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.880
I can't do that, Matilde.
You know I misbehave when I drink.

244
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.720
Shut up, I don't care.
Kiss me.

245
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.880
kiss me with tongue.

246
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.600
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, come on.

247
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.560
- So?
- It's 6:30 pm.

248
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.400
I can still watch
"The Price is Right".

249
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.400
And how are you?

250
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.800
Better. But I still feel pain
in my chest.

251
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.320
- What kind of pain?
- It's as if my chest was hurting.

252
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.960
Do you want me
to look it up online?

253
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.920
It's not worth it, Madalena,
Rodrigo should be here soon.

254
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.600
What's wrong with you,
Eduardo?

255
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.760
All of a sudden
Dr. Rodrigo is always here.

256
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.800
What are you hiding from me,
are you sick?

257
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.680
- May I?
- Come in, Rodrigo.

258
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.119
- Hello, Rodrigo.
- Hello.

259
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.480
I'm sorry,
I really have to take this call.

260
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.200
What's up, old friend?

261
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.720
I was surfing in Peniche,
but I came here as soon as I heard.

262
00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.960
Thank you, my friend.

263
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.359
What happened?

264
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.560
I got aggravated
because of my brother.

265
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.400
Eduardo, I told you before.

266
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.960
The two worst things for a person
with a heart sigh

267
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.760
is getting aggravated
and drinking water laying down.

268
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.720
I know, Rodrigo.
You told me before,

269
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.960
and I confirmed it on Yahoo!,
but life is what it is...

270
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.360
Yes, that's true.

271
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.040
Well...
Luckily, I have good news.

272
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.520
Your heart transplant is booked.

273
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.320
Really?
And when is it?

274
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.880
Thank you, Father Vitó.
I'm relieved.

275
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.200
Talking to you
is always good for me.

276
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.360
You can't imagine the stability
you brought to my life.

277
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.400
Before I met you,
this would only go away with pills

278
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.680
and "Inspetor Max" binge watching.

279
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.120
Yes, don't worry,
I will transfer the money

280
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.440
to buy the cigarette machine
for the sacristy.

281
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.440
And congratulations again on your
podcast for left-handed people.

282
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.360
We need more initiatives like that
in Portugal.

283
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.000
Yeah, man, doing the sun salute!

284
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.360
Careful with the pulled muscles, man.

285
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.080
Watch out.

286
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.720
What's up, you guys?

287
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.520
- Look, look.
- Man.

288
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.000
- Relax, everything's fine.
- Are you okay, man?

289
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.080
Everything's okay guys,
it was just an accident.

290
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.720
Working with cherries
is not for the faint of heart.

291
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.200
Is there anything you need?

292
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.800
- No, I...
- I didn't talk to you!

293
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.000
Come on, stop being silly.
You're like twenty-year-olds.

294
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.080
Sorry,
it's just that we're hyped.

295
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.520
- What are we celebrating?
- We've been invited to play

296
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.000
in a morning show on TV!

297
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.760
Are we playing
in the morning show?

298
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.920
Yeah.
Right after the yoga for divorcees.

299
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.280
- And this is all because of my story?
- No.

300
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.440
It's because of our talent.

301
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.360
Your story is worthless
without our talent, goody two shoes.

302
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.720
- What's that for?
- I don't know.

303
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.560
But I feel bad if I'm doing nothing.

304
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920
My Eduardo.

305
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.200
- Who are you?
- Criminal Police.

306
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.400
I'm inspector Paula
and he's inspector Ivo.

307
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.200
- Criminal Police.
- I've said that.

308
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.360
- Criminal Police? At this hour?
- We're investigating the fire.

309
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.200
- There are suspicions of arson.
- Suspicions?

310
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.440
- Rumours.
- Rumours?

311
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.560
Sayings.

312
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.240
Anyway, we investigated with
the people dressed in white jumpsuits

313
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.040
and the results are inconclusive.
- We didn't find lighters.

314
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.680
So, if it was arson,
it was very well done.

315
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.800
The most likely scenario
is a lightning hitting a tree

316
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.520
or a short-circuit in a cherry.

317
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.200
- What's going on here?
- Nothing, everything's okay.

318
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.400
If you need anything,
send us a messenger pigeon,

319
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.360
because our system is out.
- I will walk you out.

320
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.360
- Good afternoon.
- Thank you, inspectors.

321
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.560
- Are you better, dad?
- Yes, everything's fine.

322
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.480
Don't worry, daddy.
My God.

323
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.920
I have been putting that
on his head.

324
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.680
- What for?
- Is everyone a doctor here?

325
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.640
You put it on him, then.

326
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.640
Don't worry,
your mother's afraid of losing me.

327
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.000
But you will be okay, right?

328
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.280
Of course I will, of course.

329
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.160
It's just my heart.

330
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.160
Filipa, you have a twin sister.

331
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.240
You have a twin sister.

332
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.080
You have a twin sister.

333
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.920
You have a twin sister.

334
00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.440
You have a twin sister.

335
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.320
Filipa, you have a twin sister.

336
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.520
You have a twin sister.

337
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.680
You have a twin sister.
You have a twin sister.

338
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.720
You have a twin sister.
You have a twin sister.

339
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.640
You have a twin sister.
You have a twin sister.

340
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.880
You have a twin sister.

341
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.160
You have a twin sister.
You have a...

342
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.760
I'm sorry!

343
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.480
Filipa? You have a twin sister.
You have a twin sister.

352
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.400
Tó Mané.

353
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.320
For you to be paying for dinner,

354
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.120
there has to be something more
to it.

355
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.000
I am warning you that you're not
winning the lottery tonight.

356
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.480
- Mum...
- What?

357
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.520
Just because you brought your
girlfriend to dinner

358
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.920
I have to be fancy?
- What girlfriend?

359
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.240
I was born and raised here.

360
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.080
My teachers were the market sellers
and Cornélia.

361
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.960
It's fine by me.
I am from Massamá, so...

362
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.160
One more serving
of "innards à la sissy".

363
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.080
Careful, it's super hot.
Wait a bit.

364
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.720
Before the wine
takes hold of me,

365
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.640
I want to tell you why
I have organised this dinner.

366
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.680
Speeches?
Are you a politician now?

367
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.760
You're good at stealing,
but you're missing the diploma.

368
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.920
- Shut up.
- Let me hear, mum.

369
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.600
So here's the deal:
there's a date for my divorce,

370
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.120
so this little bird with shorts
is ready to leave the cage.

371
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.120
- Nice going, Tó Mané.
- Finally!

372
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.800
Congratulations.

373
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.280
Since we are all here together,

374
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.240
I...

375
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.880
I...

376
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.320
- I...
- Let it out, man!

377
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.400
I will hang myself again.

378
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.160
Ivone, look here...

379
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.080
Serafim,
please turn on the AC.

380
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400
Ivone.

381
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.880
Ivone.

382
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.200
Will you marry me?

383
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.400
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm serious!

384
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.560
Can't you see me
kneeling like I'm injured?

385
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.480
Get up, the food is getting cold.

386
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.200
- Give him a kiss, mum.
- I'll give him what he wants tonight.

387
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.640
I'm sorry, everyone.
There are people here.

388
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.680
- Come here...
- You're so crazy.

389
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.760
- Come here, Ivone.
- Mané, I can't.

390
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.960
You tricked me
and now you're stuck with me.

391
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080
Tó Mané.

392
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.240
- Let me go, Tó Mané.
- Long live the engaged couple!

393
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.720
Tó Mané, let her go, come on.
Let's have a toast.

394
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.880
- You're so silly.
- Let's have a toast, come on.

395
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Tó Mané.

396
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.640
- Long live the engaged couple.
- I wasn't expecting this, Tó Mané.

397
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.160
- Madalena?
- António, I didn't see you coming.

398
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.200
Can't sleep, right?

399
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.800
No, too much stuff in my head.

400
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.840
Let me guess...

401
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.640
It's the daughter
that we abandoned, right?

402
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.400
That we killed, António.
Let's not sugar-coat it.

403
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.680
Madalena...

404
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.280
Madalena,
how could we have known

405
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.640
that the boat was going to explode?

406
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.960
The signs were there.

407
00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.840
The smell of gas,
the sparks in the generator,

408
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.560
the bonfire in the deck...
We didn't want to see it.

409
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.480
It's been 30 years, Madalena.

410
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.240
You have to get over it.

411
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.120
Get over it?
How can you, António?

412
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.120
I think about the other daughter I had
every single night.

413
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.400
Another daughter?

414
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.520
Who's there?

415
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.440
Cable services!
