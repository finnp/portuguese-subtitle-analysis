SUNSET
Love comes at Night

3
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.440
End the exploitation!

4
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.080
End the exploitation!

5
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.760
End the exploitation!

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.480
End the exploitation!

7
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.360
End the exploitation!

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.920
End the exploitation!

9
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.520
End the exploitation!

10
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.160
End the exploitation!

11
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.880
End the exploitation!

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.200
End the exploitation!

13
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.880
End the exploitation!

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.560
End the exploitation!

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.160
End the exploitation!

16
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.000
End the exploitation!

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.720
What's going on, Eduardo?
What are these screams?

18
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.600
I don't know.
It seems to be the workers.

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960
What the hell is going on?

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.840
My God!
It's the end of the world!

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.280
What's going on, Maria da Piedade?

22
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.840
It's an uprising.

23
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.000
- An uprising?
- It's like the 25th of April.

24
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.600
But without sideburns.

25
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.000
- I'll go outside.
- Eduardo!

26
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.680
Please, be careful.
Put on your slippers.

27
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.560
Of course.

28
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.920
- Don't get out of here.
- No.

29
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.680
Lock the door
and if something happens to me,

30
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.240
my password to the IRS website
is José Cid, all in lowercase.

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.520
Blessed Virgin Mary.

32
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.320
Please don't let
any harm happen here.

33
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.600
Good Lord of cherries,
protect him.

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.600
Calm down.

35
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.640
Stay calm.

36
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.000
End the exploitation!

37
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.920
End the exploitation!

38
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.440
End the exploitation!

39
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.120
End the exploitation!

40
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.680
End the exploitation!

41
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.520
End the exploitation!

42
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080
Stop!

43
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.560
Stop!

44
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.760
I won't say this again.

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Stop this.

46
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.000
The first one to get inside
the boss' house

47
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.200
will end up like this pigeon.

48
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.600
You're in this with them.
You're getting money for this.

49
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.360
Explain us how did you get the money
to buy a convertible car.

50
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.840
- I won't say this again: stop!
- What's going on here?

51
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.640
We're tired of being exploited.
We're tired.

52
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.840
And we're tired of not getting Wi-Fi
on the cherry field.

53
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.440
Wi-Fi on the cherry field!

54
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.120
Wi-Fi on the cherry field!

55
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.280
- Wi-Fi on the cherry field!
- You're ungrateful!

56
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.040
If the boss hadn't given you a job,
you'd still be selling Herbal Life.

57
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.360
This is a provocation.

58
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.240
Lower your gun, António.

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.920
Calm down.

60
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.680
Whatever it is that you want,
we can talk it through.

61
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.680
Talk about what?

62
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.240
I'm 56 years old
and I've never had a credit card.

63
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.160
- 56 years old!
- 56 years old!

64
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.840
Shut up!
Get out of here!

65
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.600
This is Santarém!
And only an uprising can solve this.

66
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.720
That's it!

67
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.240
My God.

68
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.720
What have I done?

69
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.280
Stop it! Stop!

70
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.960
- Santarém?
- That's what the scientist told me.

71
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.040
The wicker from the basket
where I was found only exists there.

72
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.640
That means you're...

73
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.800
It means my family is from Santarém
and I'm "Santarese".

74
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.200
You're "Santariorker".
No, it's "Santarenian".

75
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.800
- Shouldn't it be "Santarenic"?
- I'll check online.

76
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.240
It doesn't matter, Raul.

77
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.480
Listen, whatever it is,
I have great news for you.

78
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.240
Did you manage to get José Cid
to get naked for the cover?

79
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.840
- Even better.
- Sérgio Godinho?

80
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.280
I found out a laboratory
specialised in orphan's DNA.

81
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.760
- Are you serious?
- I just need your DNA.

82
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.839
I didn't bring my DNA today.

83
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.520
- So?
- So?

84
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.240
It all ended well, miss Madalena.

85
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.440
Yes, but I had to compromise.

86
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.520
Health insurance for all of them,
eleventh month payment

87
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.880
and tickets
to Anjos' Christmas Concert.

88
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.680
Do we have money for all of that?

89
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.840
Calm down.
Don't start spiralling again.

90
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.680
I'd love to say we do,

91
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.720
but, unfortunately,

92
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.680
after my investment
in that pit radar...

93
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.000
Pit radar?

94
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.520
Yes, it's for us to be sure

95
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.600
that the cherries don't have pits.

96
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.480
I wonder how this rebellion started.

97
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.960
- Having a rough morning?
- You're a vulture, Simão.

98
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.280
You only show up
when you smell trouble.

99
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.720
Are you insinuating that I incited
this rebellion, Eduardo?

100
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.240
If you are, just say it.

101
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.360
- I'm saying it.
- Say it.

102
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.280
- I'm saying it.
- Really say it.

103
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.200
- I'm really saying it.
- No.

104
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.080
Can you stop fighting?

105
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.680
Can we be a normal family
with real problems?

106
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.760
Bank loans, cars without GPS,
water infiltrations in the kitchen.

107
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.800
Sir, Mr. Ruca's here.

108
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.840
Mr. Ruca?

109
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.080
Why do you need your lawyer,
Eduardo?

110
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.720
Come here!

111
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.520
If I wanted to be groped
I'd ride the metro to Moscavide.

112
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.760
You know you like it.

113
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.960
I like it au naturel, like prawns,
it's not with blue pills.

114
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.200
- Are there still mackerels?
- You only think about eating.

115
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.320
Come help me hang the laundry.

116
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440
Did I hurt anyone?

117
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.560
Come on.
I don't have all day.

118
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.200
Come on.

119
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.720
Give me the pegs.

120
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.960
You should've seen your sparrow
singing at the Solar do Banhadas.

121
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.000
The brits were all trembling.

122
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.480
You sing well,
but you don't make me happy.

123
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.400
Gorete, your bitch is in heat,
go get it!

124
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.960
This month, with the tips I'm getting,
we'll go to Alcântara and eat crab.

125
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.200
Save that money to buy the camera
you promised your stepson.

126
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.360
Gorete, go get your bitch.
She has four dogs on top of her.

127
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.560
Why does Raul need the camera?

128
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.560
He has a phone
with a hell of a camera.

129
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.400
Take care of the boy, Tó Mané.

130
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.120
He loves you like a father.

131
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.920
What do you want?
I almost fell.

132
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080
Me?

133
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.160
Us.

134
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.760
You're more than his mother.

135
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.200
Are you crazy?

136
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.240
Tó Mané.

137
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.600
No one can know
that I'm not his real mother.

138
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.840
Did you hear me?
This stays between us.

139
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.160
I know and you also know
that my lips are sealed.

140
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.600
Sealed with liqueur.
Your breath stinks.

141
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.560
Gorete!

142
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.680
Your bitch plays both fields.

143
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.240
She's on top of another bitch.
What a tramp.

144
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.960
Gorete!

145
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.680
Goddamn it.

146
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.040
Sunset

147
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.760
Sunset

148
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.360
Sunset

149
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.280
Sunset
Sunset

150
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.920
Sunset

151
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.080
Sunset

152
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.360
Sunset
Sunset

153
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.200
Where is she going?

154
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.240
A heart sigh, Eduardo?

155
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.960
Yes.
And I only have six months to live.

156
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.280
My only hope is finding
a compatible donor, but you know me.

157
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.400
I don't like searching for stuff.

158
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.880
I don't know what to say, Eduardo.

159
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.800
Tell me the lottery numbers.
I haven't checked them yet.

160
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.800
Seven, eleven,
twenty-seven, twenty-eight...

161
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.840
I'm sorry.
Eleven, twenty-eight...

162
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.600
- The last one?
- Twenty-eight.

163
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.560
Fifty and the stars
are three and five.

164
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.920
Nothing.

165
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.320
Well, moving on.

166
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.080
Mr. Ruca, I asked you to come
because I want to donate my goods.

167
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.920
And have you thought about
how you're distributing them?

168
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320
Not yet.

169
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.480
But I want to give the necklace
of São Cajó to my daughter, Matilde.

170
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720
The necklace of São Cajó?

171
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.280
The one that has been in the family
for over 3500 years?

172
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.680
Yes, that one.

173
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.120
The necklace of São Cajó?

174
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.680
Who's there?

175
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.160
It's the mail!

176
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.000
Awesome rehearsal.

177
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.760
- It was so-so.
- Kick-ass.

178
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.040
I don't know why no one
has ever hired us to perform.

179
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.960
What do you mean?
We play here on the weekends.

180
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.640
Yes, but we don't get paid.

181
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.920
Lourenço,
you've been very negative.

182
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.440
It's almost as if you've organised
an uprising in the estate.

183
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.840
Don't say that, do you hear me?
Don't say that.

184
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.760
- It wasn't me.
- I know, but he does Jiu-jitsu.

185
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.280
- Chill, Lourenço.
- Breathe, calm down.

186
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.680
Yeah.

187
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.360
Lourenço's right.

188
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.040
We don't get paid
and I need the money.

189
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.280
Every day I go get food
at the food bank against famine.

190
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.480
Against hunger.

191
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.000
No, against famine.
It's only for vegans and it's great!

192
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.440
They give us a bag of linseed,
roots and cork rolls.

193
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.680
Lourenço, want a massage?

194
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.560
You need to relax a bit.
You're super tense.

195
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.280
If you want to relax,
I have something really good.

196
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.200
Dude, what have we said
about drugs?

197
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.560
I don't want drugs in the group.

198
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.840
Drugs are bad for society.
Just take a look at 9/11.

199
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.760
You agree with everything he says.

200
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.440
What do drugs
have to do with 9/11?

201
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.600
Everything.
You need to read more.

202
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.040
I don't need to read.

203
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.280
I only need my guitar.

204
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.600
Take a look at my brother.

205
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.400
He read a lot to be a nurse
and he didn't find a job in Portugal.

206
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.760
He had to go to Almada.

207
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.800
Stop being nerds.

208
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.480
What's going on?

209
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.160
Miss Filipa
says I do everything wrong.

210
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.600
Carla, don't be like that.

211
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.440
Just yesterday
you served me a great decaf.

212
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.320
Am I only good for that?

213
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.000
I had training in multinational
leadership in the field of robotics.

214
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.680
Carla, organise this by date,
value and paper weight.

215
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.880
Of course.

216
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.720
You need to value yourself more.

217
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600
You're a beautiful
and independent woman.

218
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.000
You have a payments app.

219
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.400
It's true.
You need to believe in yourself.

220
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.640
For example, how many girls your age
have made out with José Cid?

221
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.640
I don't even remember it that well.
I was drunk.

222
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.880
Listen to me.

223
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.920
You need to believe more in yourself.
Don't give up on yourself.

224
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.760
Thank you, Raul.

225
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.200
Organise these papers for me, okay?

226
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.080
By the way, Carla,
organise this as well.

227
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.080
Are you sure you want to give
your best horse to António?

228
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.440
Yes.

229
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.440
António deserves Testicle.

230
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.200
I know he'll treat him right
and they have similar stories.

231
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.240
Despite the difficulties,
António got where he is.

232
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.280
And Testicle became
the best racing horse in the world,

233
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.160
despite having just one testicle.

234
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.880
Maybe it's related.
Maybe it is more aerodynamic.

235
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.320
No...

236
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.880
It's his fire.

237
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.680
He holds the record
for the fastest lap

238
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.280
in the Track of Estoril.

239
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.840
Very well, if that's what you want,
I'll send you the papers tomorrow.

240
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.280
Thank you, Mr. Ruca.

241
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.840
Thank you, Eduardo.

242
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.600
- Miss Matilde.
- Mr. Ruca.

243
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.080
- Matilde.
- Father.

244
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.560
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Yes, sit down.

245
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.200
What's going on?

246
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.320
You look so serious.

247
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.800
My daughter,

248
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.400
I've decided to give you

249
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.080
the most precious asset
this family possesses.

250
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.280
The recipe for duck with rice?

251
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.600
No, that's for a guy that once helped
me change a tire in Abrantes.

252
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.800
He had a limp, but was energetic.

253
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.840
Then, what is it?
I can't guess.

254
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.960
The necklace of São Cajó.

255
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.360
The necklace of São Cajó.

256
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.800
The one that has been in our family
for more than 3500 years.

257
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.320
Yes, Matilde.

258
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.160
You're the new guardian
of the Linhaça de Bourbon's necklace.

259
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.600
What's wrong with you, father?

260
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.680
Simão.

261
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.080
Simão.

262
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.360
These dates
are getting more intense.

263
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.880
Two hours behind closed doors.

264
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.760
What was my brother doing
with Dr. Ruca?

265
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.120
I need to shower.

266
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.160
It's the fourth time this week

267
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.920
I get home to my husband
while smelling like whiskey.

268
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.640
There's something going on
in this house.

269
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.160
I have to find out what.

270
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.200
Can I help, Simão?

271
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.320
Not with this, Constança.

272
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.720
But I need to ask you for a favour.

273
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.360
- Want me dress like Rosinha again?
- Good idea, but no.

274
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.440
As the vet of the estate,
you have access to the horses, right?

275
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.200
Yes, but why do you ask?

276
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.520
Thanks to my contacts in Dubai,

277
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.160
I found an experimental serum
that makes horses run backwards.

278
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.960
Run backwards?

279
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.240
But then...
They'll lose all their value.

280
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.680
Exactly.

281
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.960
Tomorrow, you'll inject that serum

282
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.400
in the most valuable horse
of the Pôr do Sol Estate:

283
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.520
the Testicle.

284
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.480
Where have you been, Lourenço?

285
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.200
Me?

286
00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.520
I was at my band's rehearsal.

287
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.000
Your band?

288
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.920
And that band keeps you fed?

289
00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.079
Not now, but one day it will.

290
00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.440
You'll see.
I'll be more famous than José Cid.

291
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.640
Than José Cid?

292
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.280
José Cid has concerts in Spain!

293
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.600
Don't be ridiculous.

294
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.320
I don't understand
why you don't believe in me.

295
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.640
To make a man out of you.

296
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.120
Why am I not a man?

297
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.600
Because I play guitar?

298
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.640
Because I don't walk naked
around the house like you?

299
00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.720
Because you do everything
except what's really important.

300
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.080
Did you know we had an uprising
in the estate?

301
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.200
I was hit with a cherry pit
in this eye.

302
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.520
- Dad...
- Get off of me.

303
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.280
Are you alright?

304
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.760
If you were really worried,
you would have been next to me.

305
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.320
You would have grabbed my riffle.

306
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.400
You would have made me
turkey ham sandwiches,

307
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.760
so that I don't mess up my diet.

308
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.960
I'm so sorry, dad.

309
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.280
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.080
If I find out

311
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.680
who was the bastard
that started the uprising,

312
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.400
I'll gut him.
I'll cut everything out.

313
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.800
All of him.

314
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:12.080
What's going on, my lady?
It's 5 pm and you're still in bed.

315
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.560
Come on.
The Sun's so beautiful.

316
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.960
The wind's warm.

317
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.360
And Alcino's son has his shirt off.

318
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.600
- What's wrong?
- Let me be, Maria da Piedade.

319
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.920
I don't want to see anyone.

320
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.160
Just bring me a Gameboy
and let me be.

321
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.440
My lady,

322
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.080
you know your depression
makes you feel bad sometimes.

323
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.400
But you have to resist
and move on.

324
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.000
Move on?

325
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.720
Yes.
Just take a look at Agostinho.

326
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.360
He lost a leg
and learned how to dance samba.

327
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.760
He has been on "Praça da Alegria"
and everything.

328
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.160
You don't understand.

329
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.440
No one understands me.

330
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.240
I have a secret

331
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.680
that has been eating me up
for 30 years

332
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.040
and that doesn't let me be happy.

333
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.240
Calm down.

334
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.240
Don't be upset.

335
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.120
I think I know how to help you.

336
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.480
No one can help me,
Maria da Piedade.

337
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.760
I've tried going to shrinks,
meditating,

338
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.720
voluntary work with the deaf,

339
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.000
but nothing gets me rid of this pain.

340
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.680
Don't cry, my lady.

341
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.880
Look,

342
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.360
I was also very upset
when Anselmo Ralph left "The Voice".

343
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.200
But then,

344
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.840
I managed to get over it.

345
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.600
But how?

346
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.200
How?

347
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.360
With the help of my church,
the Church of Thingy All Mighty.

348
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.360
I've never been a woman of faith.

349
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.720
Maybe that's the problem.

350
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.800
But, you know,

351
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.560
I've learned that it's never too late.

352
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.120
I just want to be happy.

353
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.640
Happy like the Dalai Lama
or João Baião.

354
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.360
Am I asking for too much?

355
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.960
Sunset

356
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.920
Sunset

357
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.160
Sunset

358
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.680
Sunset

359
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.640
Sunset

360
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.240
Sunset

361
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.880
Sunset

362
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.600
Sunset

363
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.480
Sunset

364
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.080
Sunset

365
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.920
That sassy brit.

366
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.680
I said: "You don't pay? I'll make
your teeth fly to your forehead."

367
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.840
Did you hear me, clown?

368
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.760
- Hey.
- Hey what? I'm talking to you.

369
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.280
You don't pay attention to me.

370
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.080
What's that?
You've been staring at it all night.

371
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.440
It's DNA.

372
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.000
Shut up.

373
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.360
Last time, I got so high on that...

374
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.280
Nando, it's DNA.

375
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.800
It's information about who we are.

376
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.520
Why do I tell you this?
You only finished fourth grade.

377
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.840
- But I have a Master's in tongues.
- Yeah, you do.

378
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.800
We learn nothing from you.
Serafim, bring us two beers.

379
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.520
Tell me what that is.

380
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.960
It's so that Filipa can find out
who her parents are.

381
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.840
Filipa...

382
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.040
If she ever wants kids
instead of parents...

383
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.960
Nando, what's this?
Madragoa?

384
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.320
It is!

385
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.960
Am I talking to you?

386
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.720
Testicle.

387
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.920
Testicle, sometimes it seems
only you understand me.

388
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.360
One day, I'll buy you.

389
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.840
When I'm famous.

390
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.840
You'll never have to run again.

391
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.680
And you'll have the life you deserve.

392
00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.120
Rest, love and another mare.

393
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.400
Things won't always be like this.

394
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.800
I figured you'd be here.

395
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.040
Matilde?

396
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.960
What are you doing here?

397
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.080
How did you know I'd be here?

398
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.400
At this hour, you'd either be here
or playing darts at the bar.

399
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.600
I don't feel like playing darts.

400
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.440
We either feel it
or it isn't worth playing.

401
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.440
What's going on?
Why are you avoiding me?

402
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.080
I'm not.

403
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.400
I just got a lot of work.

404
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.960
Don't lie to me.
I saw you taking a nap in the well.

405
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.560
- Are you stalking me?
- Lourenço, what's going on?

406
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.360
Is it your father?

407
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.760
- He'll never accept our love.
- But why?

408
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.440
Why, Matilde?

409
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.440
He's from a different generation,

410
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.000
one that thinks employees
don't date their bosses,

411
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.440
that you only go
to the beach in the morning

412
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.160
and that cars have to warm up.
- No.

413
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.520
He knows something we don't.

414
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.520
And we know something
he doesn't know.

415
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.320
That we love each other.

416
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.120
No.

417
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840
No.

418
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.800
We better not.

419
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.760
It has to be.

420
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.960
I had oysters for dinner
and I can't control myself.

421
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.600
António, I've changed your sheets.

422
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.640
And I left a vegetable pot-stew
on your bedside table,

423
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.960
in case you get hungry
during the night.

424
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.960
Maria da Piedade,
what would I do without you?

425
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.680
If at least you were pretty,

426
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.040
I'd probably make you a happy woman.

427
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.960
But since you're not...

428
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.720
You can't drink
without sating absurd things.

429
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.680
- Give me that.
- Where are you taking my glass?

430
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.520
It's enough for today.

431
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.400
Wash the olive trees tomorrow,
there's a magazine crew coming.

432
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.280
- Excuse me, mister António.
- What are you doing here?

433
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.720
Have you skinned all the blackbirds?

434
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.960
Yes, that's done.

435
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.080
But you wanted me to find out
who started this uprising and I did.

436
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.200
- Tell me, come on.
- It was...

437
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.960
Maria da Piedade is one of us.
You can speak freely.

438
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.240
Well, mister António,

439
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.800
it was your son who organised this.

440
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.640
It was Lourenço.

441
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.000
Lourenço?

442
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.520
Your son?

443
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.400
My son?

444
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.640
Lourenço?

445
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200
- Lourenço.
- Your son?

446
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.800
My son?

447
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.240
Lourenço?

448
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.800
Lourenço.

449
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.560
It was Lourenço!

450
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.800
