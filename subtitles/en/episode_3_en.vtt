00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.480
SUNSET
Love comes at Night

3
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.880
Dad?
Why are you up so late?

4
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.640
How could you?

5
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.600
As much as I try,
I just can't get my head around it.

6
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.160
It was only a few kisses, Dad.
I swear.

7
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200
How could you

8
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.720
start a rebellion
here at the estate?

9
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.920
What if things went south?
What if something got out of hand?

10
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.280
What if the horses caught on fire?
If someone hit the boss?

11
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.640
Or if someone
groped the boss' wife?

12
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.040
I'm sorry, dad.

13
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.840
You're sorry...

14
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.920
That's all you do! Say you're sorry
and ask for name brand shoes!

15
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.200
I thought it was a fair fight!

16
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.480
Fair? Fair?

17
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.360
The Bourbon de Linhaça family
gave us everything!

18
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.160
Even last Christmas,
the boss gave us his hand-me-downs!

19
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.320
He even gave all the staff
a Blockbuster membership!

20
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.600
- Blockbuster doesn't exist anymore!
- That's not the point!

21
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.520
It's the thought that counts!

22
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.120
- You're right, dad, I'm sorry.
- You're a bit late for that.

23
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.600
For the next month and a half,

24
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960
there's no more crisps for you!

25
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.199
No! No!

26
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.600
No!

27
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.640
Come on, sing with me!

28
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.600
And even though she was crippled

29
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.720
Still, the brit groped her arse!

30
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.960
- Thank you very much.
- You're great, Tó Mané!

31
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.040
- Tó Mané is larger than life tonight.
- There's a lot that's large about him.

32
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.520
- Come on, mom.
- What?

33
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.120
Hunger in Africa is less depressing
than seeing your stepdad naked.

34
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.960
Trust me, Raul, I know!

35
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.600
And then they talk about Marisa
and Dulce being famous abroad.

36
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.080
This couple is from Japan!

37
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.520
- No! We're from Manteigas.
- Hush it!

38
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.840
Let me grab something,
I'm feeling peckish.

39
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.560
Why are you on your mobile
with all these fine lasses here?

40
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.240
So what?
I'm waiting on the DNA results.

41
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.920
- Is there a Champions match today?
- Never mind...

42
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.400
You keep waiting!

43
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.920
Soon you'll be 75. Do you know
what you'll be able to raise then?

44
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.480
Only your eyebrows!

45
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.960
It's true, love! Everything will sag
once you're an old hag.

46
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.200
And it rhymes!
Yeah, go on!

47
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.920
Come on!

48
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.880
And even though she was crippled

49
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.320
Go, Tó Mané!

50
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.520
Still, the brit groped her arse!

51
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.280
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

52
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.720
- You roaring lion, you!
- Thank you.

53
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.920
- You see what's going on in there?
- Yes, yes.

54
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.080
- Who's that with Cristina?
- I'd like to know that too.

55
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.520
I only know he's Artur Menezes
and he's mad about samosas.

56
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.400
- How do you know that?
- I checked his InstaPic.

57
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.120
There's even a picture of him
eating samosas underwater.

58
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.800
I don't like where this is going.
I smell trouble for us.

59
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.360
Shut it! Everything's a tragedy
for you poor people.

60
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.840
You're all about illness,
crooked teeth, scratch cards...

61
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.840
Speaking of tragedy, there was
a problem with your DNA, Filipa.

62
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960
How so?

63
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.720
One of the lab's technicians
had his birthday

64
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.960
and your DNA got spilled
into the sangria.

65
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.200
- So what now?
- They'll need more of your DNA.

66
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.200
Well, that sucks! I'll have to look
for more of it in the box room.

67
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.920
You'd better keep an eye
on what's going on in there.

68
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.720
- Ten million?
- I already told you, Artur.

69
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.920
This magazine is not for sale.

70
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.920
- 20 million?
- No!

71
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.400
- 15?
- Stop it!

72
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.640
- Seven?
- Artur, that's enough!

73
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.200
As long as I'm the CEO,
Blaze is not for sale!

74
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.480
You'd be ill advised
to say no to a man like me.

75
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.520
Are you threatening me, Artur?

76
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.920
Takes one to know one.

77
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.240
Poor thing...

78
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.000
Tell me, my friend! What urgent news
do you have for me?

79
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.280
Eduardo,

80
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.920
I even left mid-surgery because
I wanted to give you the news myself.

81
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040
Mid-surgery?

82
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.880
He's young,
he'll do fine with only one lung.

83
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.960
Have a seat.
You're making me nervous, old friend.

84
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.360
So what is the news?

85
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.480
Eduardo,

86
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.120
we found a heart donor
that's a match for you.

87
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.400
- No... No way!
- It's true.

88
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.360
You finally found someone with
my blood type? ABS Positive?

89
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.000
Yes! He died two hours ago,
in a Fortnite accident.

90
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.840
My God!

91
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.440
- Zé Figueiras?
- Shit! That's not the one, sorry!

92
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.880
Here you go!

93
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.360
Poor chap!

94
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.800
- Well, he was an old man, anyway...
- No! He was 36 years old.

95
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.120
Partied every night
and had no skincare routine,

96
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.000
but what matters is we found
a matching heart donor, Eduardo!

97
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.440
A carp donor? My brother
doesn't event like fish soup.

98
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.800
What is this noise?
Is someone out there?

99
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.160
Publicity!

100
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.160
VANDA'S BAR

101
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.720
Stop!
Stop it! Stop!

102
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.760
Jimmy, you're too slow.
Diogo, you're too fast.

103
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.080
- Vera, that's "Jardins Proibidos".
- That was our song.

104
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.000
Hey, now!
His babe is over there.

105
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.560
I'm playing slow 'cause
I'm feeling faint as hell, man.

106
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.560
Have you eaten today, Jimmy?

107
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.840
- He refused the burger I gave him.
- I'm vegan, man!

108
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.440
Being vegan is not a choice,
it's a way of life, mate!

109
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.320
You must wear twill, wife-beaters,
and respect all animals.

110
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.080
If a mosquito bit me,
I wouldn't kill him, man!

111
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.080
I'd have a conversation
with him, mate.

112
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.040
Sure! And I'm the one
smoking funny things!

113
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.000
- Get more tobacco in it!
- What's she doing here anyway?

114
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.200
She's my girlfriend.
Got a problem?

115
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.760
Well...
Are we rehearsing or not?

116
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.160
If we're to be the next
Ala dos Namorados, we must smash it!

117
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.760
Indeed.

118
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.000
- A crisp?
- No, I don't want a crisp!

119
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.480
You don't?
But you love crisps, mate.

120
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.559
Yeah. I love crisps, but I must learn
to pay for my mistakes.

121
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.400
Let's go, man!

122
00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.480
"Drug is a pit", from the start!

123
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.200
Cristina...

124
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.440
- Can't you tell me what he wanted?
- I already told you, Filipa.

125
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.720
You worry about selling magazines,
I'll worry about the rest.

126
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.800
Speaking of which,
how were the sales this month?

127
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.320
I don't know the numbers
by heart.

128
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.040
- Carla?
- Yes?

129
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.040
How many magazines
did we sell this month?

130
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.840
Hurry up, Carla!
Cristina's waiting.

131
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.400
I don't know about the magazines,
but coffees...

132
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.400
Enough! You're useless!
Go get us coffee!

133
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.640
Coffee, coffee, coffee!

134
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.680
- I hate women who wear shorts.
- Filipa!

135
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.080
Don't lash out your frustrations
on the girl.

136
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.160
Have you been meditating,
like I told you?

137
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.040
Where do I find the time?

138
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.040
With the magazine, the DNA,
"Weight Watchers"...

139
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.840
Sunset
Sunset

140
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.200
Sunset

141
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.200
Sunset
Sunset

142
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.560
Sunset

143
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.600
Sunset

144
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.800
Sunset

145
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.640
Sunset

146
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.000
Sunset

147
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.000
Thank you very much for coming,
Father Vitó!

148
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.840
Maria da Piedade
spoke very highly of you.

149
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.920
I must confess, I know nothing about
the Church of the Thingy All Mighty.

150
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.280
We're a church like any other,
Madalena.

151
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.400
The only differences are that
our sacramental bread is gluten-free

152
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.440
and we pray while squatting.

153
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.600
Well...
I'm not even sure where to begin.

154
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.080
How about you start
from the beginning, Madalena?

155
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.440
Go on, tell me.

156
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.240
What saddens you so much?

157
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.280
It's a secret of my past,
Father Vitó.

158
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.240
Mine
and the Bourbon de Linhaça's pasts.

159
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.760
We all hold secrets
from our past, Madalena.

160
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.880
I, for instance, had a barbecue place
in São Domingos de Rana...

161
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.840
I wouldn't dare tell you
what I served as chicken.

162
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.160
You could almost
hear them meow.

163
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.120
My secret is a bit more serious,
Father.

164
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.960
Much more serious!

165
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.000
Speak up.
Speak freely.

166
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.640
Anything you tell me is bound
by confessional secrecy.

167
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.120
Father,
I have abandoned a daughter!

168
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.040
I'm sure you had your reasons,
Madalena.

169
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.200
Our Thingy All Mighty
does not judge.

170
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.560
He taunts you,
but he won't judge.

171
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.320
I've abandoned her

172
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.240
and she died before my eyes
because I abandoned her.

173
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.320
Every day I wonder
where she could be

174
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.640
had she not died, Father.

175
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.120
There, there, Madalena!

176
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.160
It's okay, Madalena, it's okay!

177
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.040
All you can do now
is take care of yourself

178
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.480
and transfer 1500 Euros
to my account.

179
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.120
There, there!

180
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.360
Again? I've told you,
I'm very pleased with my plan.

181
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.600
Why would I want to subscribe
to a Moroccan movies channel?

182
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.200
I have enough dirty channels, thanks.
I don't need "Hot Algarvias".

183
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.520
Fine then, if it's only 3 Euros.
Have a nice day.

184
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.440
There's no one watching.
Go, Constança, go.

185
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.000
I'm only giving Testicle this shot
for you, Simão.

186
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
Yeah, sure. Hurry, I want to see
Farense's second half.

187
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.960
I'm scared.

188
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.240
Testicle is very unpredictable,
he might kick me.

189
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.800
Constança...

190
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.240
Don't worry,
I've brought disinfectant. Now go.

191
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.680
Yes...

192
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.200
Your forward racing days are over,
Testicle.

193
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.640
Damn, he kicked her
like a sack of potatoes!

194
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.480
Farense's second half, right.

195
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.280
Matilde!

196
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.640
- Matilde!
- Lourenço, what's going on?

197
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.600
Miss Matilde, I'm sorry,
but I couldn't stop him

198
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.880
from coming in
wearing his muddy boots.

199
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.920
How could you?

200
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.680
What?
How could I what, Lourenço?

201
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.280
This.
How could you do this?

202
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
- You betrayed my trust.
- Lourenço.

203
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.720
That's no way to talk
to Miss Matilde.

204
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.240
Lourenço, that's a story.

205
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.480
What's wrong with that?
It's a story of you guys playing.

206
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.200
I should never have taken you
to our rehearsal.

207
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.720
- You filmed it without us knowing!
- What's wrong with that?

208
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.360
Lourenço, either leave now
or I'll call Sandra Felgueiras!

209
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.480
What's wrong with that?

210
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.600
What's wrong with that?

211
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.600
We made a blood pact!
A bloody blood pact, Matilde!

212
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:43.240
We agreed to only announce the band
when we were ready.

213
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.200
And you threw it all way,
Matilde.

214
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.200
I'm sorry, Lourenço, I had no idea.
I swear I won't do it again.

215
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.720
No, you won't.
And do you know why?

216
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.720
Because we're over.

217
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.840
Lourenço, no... No!
Lourenço! Lourenço!

218
00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.520
Lourenço, no!

219
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.080
- Raul. Can I borrow 20 Euros?
- What do you want 20 Euros for?

220
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.160
To get an Uber to Amadora.
I pull more birds there.

221
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.160
- You should be studying, go home!
- Sod off!

222
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.760
Come on, Carla, eat something.
These pastries look so good.

223
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.160
No, Raul, stop.
I don't want them.

224
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.080
We're still splitting the check,
though.

225
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.360
It's so sad to be reaching 35
and no one respects you, you know?

226
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.600
Not at home, not at the office.
Not even in the metro.

227
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.200
- You're not drinking your juice?
- No.

228
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.120
This juice is made
from the best oranges from Algarve.

229
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.480
Free of sugar,
colourings and preservatives,

230
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.120
and packed full of vitamins B,
C, Z and T2.

231
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.160
Gives you the energy you need
to get through your busy day.

232
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.080
- Why do you care so much for me?
- You deserve the best, Carla.

233
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.640
You know how many dudes told me that
when all they wanted was nudes?

234
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.960
- Gotcha!
- Come on!

235
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.800
I was watching you.

236
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.480
- Aren't you going to introduce us?
- This is Carla, my co-worker.

237
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.440
Hello. Well... If I were your age,
I wouldn't be wasting time.

238
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.360
- Why don't you go home, Tó Mané?
- I'm petrified, no joke.

239
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.560
- What happened?
- I'm scared. Sorry, hon.

240
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.280
I was just at court
and the divorce still isn't final.

241
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.600
I won't be able
to marry your mother this year.

242
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.480
I'm at an age
were I can say anything.

243
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.520
Portuguese justice
only wants to suck you dry.

244
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.240
Sorry,
my stepfather is very frank.

245
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.800
What are you drinking?

246
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.120
We're drinking this juice
made from the best oranges...

247
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.760
Juice?
What am I? Five?

248
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.360
See you later!

249
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.600
Is he always like this?

250
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.160
No, it worsens during Saint Anthony
festivities, he wears shorts.

251
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.800
But he loves my mother
and that's all that matters.

252
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.280
I'm glad to see you're painting again,
Madalena.

253
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.000
Yes, I talked with someone today
and it helped me quite a bit.

254
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.360
May I ask
what you are painting?

255
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.520
I never really know, Eduardo,
I paint whatever pops in my head.

256
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.440
Let me see.

257
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.840
Fernando Mendes?

258
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.760
Boss!

259
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.400
Something tragic happened.

260
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.080
What was it now, António?
Another fire at the dam?

261
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.720
No, far worse than that!

262
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.360
Testicle
started running backwards.

263
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.280
- What do you mean?
- What?

264
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.040
I wanted to volt him
and took him out to the paddock

265
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.120
and he just started to run backwards
and to kick forward.

266
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.400
How is that possible?
That horse cost seven billion Euros!

267
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.280
Without VAT, Mrs. Madalena.

268
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.960
We're ruined.
The Bourbon de Linhaça are ruined.

269
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.680
Don't worry, boss,

270
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.720
if the cherry harvest goes well,
we can sort it out.

271
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.120
Let's pray they're pitted.

272
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.520
Yes. Right now, the cherry harvest
is our family's only hope.

273
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.520
Don't be like that, Miss.

274
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.200
How? How am I not to be like this,
Maria da Piedade?

275
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.240
Lourenço is the only one
and true love of my life.

276
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.800
I live for him.

277
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.640
And for the fight for gender equality
in civil services.

278
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.320
Lourenço was hot-headed.

279
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.640
Everything will be fine,
you'll see.

280
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.160
Men are all the same.

281
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.400
But they always come back
when they want to bed us.

282
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.280
- You think?
- I'm sure.

283
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.000
It was only a story,
Maria da Piedade.

284
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.560
What could be wrong
with one story?

285
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.240
I don't know, Miss.
I don't know much about those things.

286
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.400
I only use the Internet
to buy bitcoin.

287
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.880
Can I give you some advice, though?

288
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.920
Yes.
What is it, Maria da Piedade?

289
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.560
Forget about Lourenço.

290
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.440
If his dad
is against your relationship,

291
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.000
he must have a valid reason.

292
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.040
What reason could be so valid,
Maria da Piedade?

293
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.000
I don't know.

294
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.600
It's just one more of the many secrets
at the Pôr do Sol estate.

295
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.440
Sunset
Sunset

296
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.440

297
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.680

Sunset

298
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.680

301
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.120
Sun

302
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.560
Crazy Tó?

303
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.360
- Pedro Granger?
- Yes.

304
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.920
You look different
from your profile picture.

305
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.840
It's a filter.

306
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.600
I can tell you which one,
if you want.

307
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.040
Why are we meeting like this,
here?

308
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.000
It's like in the movies.

309
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.760
No need for us to exit the cars,
and should the cops arrive,

310
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.240
I'll bail this way,
and you'll bail that way.

311
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.280
- But there's a wall over there.
- Hey!

312
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.600
I haven't told you what to do yet
and you already have excuses?

313
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.080
Go on!

314
00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.640
- Do you know the Pôr do Sol state?
- Everybody knows that estate.

315
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.520
Very well.

316
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.400
The job will take place
at the Pôr do Sol estate.

317
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.400
Should you do it well,
I'll pay you 10 million Euros.

318
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.240
- Cash?
- Cash!

319
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.800
Cash is a must!

320
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.240
I'm on unemployment benefits.

321
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.600
If they find 10 million in my account,
they'll cut me off.

322
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.120
No worries.
I'll pay you 100 Euros now,

323
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.760
1000 once you start,
half a million on your birthday

324
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.640
and the rest
when the job is done.

325
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.080
- And what is the job?
- It's very simple.

326
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.280
Just set the Pôr do Sol estate's
cherry trees on fire.
