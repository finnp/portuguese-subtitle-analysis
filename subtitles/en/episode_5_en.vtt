present

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.320
SUNSET
Love comes at Night

3
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.520
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.

4
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.680
It's just a heart transplant.

5
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.320
- What I fear is the anaesthesia.
- Promise you won't die.

6
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840
What nonsense...

7
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.000
Has anyone ever died
of a heart transplant?

8
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.520
It's almost as if I'm being circumcised!

9
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.640
Hey, champ! Are we ready
for the "cut and sew"?

10
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.120
Let's go, old pal.

11
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.800
Promise me it will all go well,
Rodrigo.

12
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.120
It's as if your father
is being circumcised!

13
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.600
If it all goes as planned, how long
will Eduardo have to stay here?

14
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.680
Five to six days, I would say.

15
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.520
Good!
I can go to Nauticampo, then.

16
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.760
Let's go, I have a neurology
appointment this afternoon.

17
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.720
My hands have been shaking.
Look at this.

18
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.560
I'll see you in a bit.

19
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.000
Madalena...

20
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.360
- If I don't survive...
- Don't say that!

21
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480
... promise two things to me.
Promise, please...

22
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.200
... you'll marry again.

23
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.680
And promise you'll delete
my browsing history...

24
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.720
... without seeing it.

25
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.760
I promise, Eduardo...
I promise.

26
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.680
Let's go.

27
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760
Eduardo.

28
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.800
Regardless of everything,
we're brothers,

29
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.280
and that has its meaning.
Blood is blood.

30
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.760
Maybe my new heart will help me
forgive you, Simão.

31
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.560
This one can't do it.

32
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.320
Let's go.

33
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.240
I don't have anything to say
to this gentleman.

34
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.840
- What are you doing, Simão?
- We need to talk, Madalena.

35
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.200
- Talk about what?
- About your other daughter!

36
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.320
Focus solely on the asthmatic
whales of Patagonia singing...

37
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440
Filipa...

38
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.600
... inhale...

39
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.320
... exhale...

40
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.760
You... are the whale.

41
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.160
You... Are you fat?
To lose weight, click on the...

42
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.920
Damn advertising!
Always the same with free tutorials!

43
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.160
- Filipa?
- What?

44
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.120
Here's this month's magazine,
at first-hand.

45
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.720
Your cover is on the stands,
superstar!

46
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.040
You chose this damn picture?
I look like I still eat bread!

47
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.440
- Well, I like it.
- You know what I'd like, Raul?

48
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.560
- That you'd find out who my twin is.
- I will.

49
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.400
I've been on two dark web boards:
"Tuga Twins" and "I'd do both".

50
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.720
But this takes time!

51
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.000
Don't you think I know that?
I've been searching for 30 years!

52
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.839
What sister, Simão?
Matilde is an only child.

53
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.800
Have you ever seen her
sharing a dessert?

54
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.960
Who told you that?

55
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.560
You know that walls have ears,
Madalena.

56
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.160
Why that informal speech?

57
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.240
What do you want
from this conversation?

58
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.800
What do I want?

59
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800
It's simple.

60
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.240
I want... the São Cajó necklace!

61
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.560
The São Cajó necklace?

62
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.880
The one that's been in the Bourbon
de Linhaça family for over 3500 years?

63
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.160
Precisely.

64
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.720
Do you want to blackmail me?

65
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.840
This female astuteness
is quite curious.

66
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
Eduardo is right.
You're unscrupulous, Simão!

67
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.240
You don't deserve to be called
a Bourbon de Linhaça

68
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.560
and shouldn't be allowed
to embroider it on polo shirts!

69
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680
I know.

70
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.480
Silence!
Are you at home?

71
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.440
You aren't worth a thing!
A thing!

72
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.160
But the necklace is. According
to the Portuguese Necklace Institute,

73
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.960
it's worth six thousand millions
of millions of millions of millions...

74
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.680
... of Euros.

75
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.920
So, I can be an unscrupulous man,
but I will be a very rich one.

76
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.000
If you don't give me the necklace,

77
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.480
I will tell Eduardo
that you have another daughter.

78
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.080
Do I need to go over there
or what?

79
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.880
What a missile.

80
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.560
If Americans had a weapon like this,
they would've won the war.

81
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.000
And they say
that flowers don't walk!

82
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.080
They walk, alright...
You... beautiful!

83
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.200
Want a sardine?

84
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.080
Look, you idiot!
Instead of your John Travolta show,

85
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.440
how about taking care of the coal?
- Wait, calm down.

86
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.760
You woke up in a bad mood,
is that right?

87
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.200
- I'm taking care of it.
- Give me that, Tó Mané!

88
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.720
Go away, Tó Mané!

89
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.680
Look!
That's what we really needed.

90
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.680
Driving like an insane person!

91
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.640
Tó Mané! Brother Nando
comes on an emergency mission.

92
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.440
Are you feeling well, Tó Mané?
Are you breathing well?

93
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.800
- Yes.
- I heard you're hanging yourself again.

94
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.680
Worse than flies! He smells sardine
and comes flying right away.

95
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.600
- It smells great.
- I want to talk with you, trickster.

96
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.640
Pick up your clothes, Elsa,
or they will smell of "Somos Portugal"!

97
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.560
- A... ring?
- Yes, a ring! Why is it so strange?

98
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.560
An engagement ring for Ivone.

99
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.440
- A gold one?
- Of course, as it should be!

100
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.320
A man marries two or three times only,
no more!

101
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.000
That's right.

102
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.480
- You're certain of it.
- Of course.

103
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.240
Let's see what Nando can do
to help, okay?

104
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.840
Tó Mané, in the meantime,

105
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.040
give me a sardine, will you?
I'm starving!

106
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.000
Ivone!
Add two more for Nando.

107
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.920
Just like that?
If he's hungry, he can go to Sidónio!

108
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.920
Look at him...

109
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.640
- I will convince her.
- Get a job!

110
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.680
- At least one...
- Shut up.

111
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.480
- Do you want a magazine?
- Ask for "Bulls & Fitness".

112
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.480
It's right here.
I'm getting one myself.

113
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.840
"Rich Kids Décor".
Do you want it too?

114
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
My God! It can't be...

115
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.799
Mum? Mum!
No, mum...

116
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.600
Mum...
Someone help me, please!

117
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.040
She suffers from celiac disease!

118
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880
Mum...

119
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.520
- When does the rehearsal end?
- Until we can. We must be at our best.

120
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.440
If the TV performance goes well,

121
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.480
it can be the chance we needed
for our Vine popularity!

122
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.280
- Vine is gone, man.
- Are you kidding?

123
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.120
Can't access MySpace because
I'm out of data, how should I know?

124
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.680
- Accept that job at the estate!
- Do I need to repeat? I'm vegan.

125
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.000
- You only need to cut wood, man.
- Wood has feelings too, dude.

126
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.000
Nature is unique.

127
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.920
Humans, animals, plants, mushrooms,
we are all the same, dude!

128
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.480
Yes...
I'm smoking a joint.

129
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.560
Shouldn't we have a name?

130
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.080
You're right, we should.

131
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.400
Lourenço & The Pubes.

132
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.240
- Lourenço and the what now?
- What's the problem?

133
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.600
- He started it, he's the leader.
- Solve it in bed, okay?

134
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.240
- No, he's right.
- I'm not buying that!

135
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.040
Exactly. We are a band,
we are all equal.

136
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.360
Linhaça Holocaust, man.

137
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.000
Masonic Funeral.

138
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.240
- Spirulina Nation.
- The Clit.

139
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440
No?

140
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.840
I got it.

141
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.120
Jesus...

142
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.640
... Cyst.

143
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.520
Dude...!

144
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.640
Jesus Cyst!

145
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.200
Yeah, man! Yeah, man!

146
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.600
Please, mum.
Take a bite of this chorizo bread.

147
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.520
The nurse said you needed to eat.

148
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.000
No, I can't digest it very well.

149
00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.240
I just want to sit down.

150
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.160
What's wrong? You got so weird
after talking with uncle Simão.

151
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.320
- What did you talk about?
- Nothing important.

152
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.480
Issues related to Pôr do Sol estate.
And the Europa League final.

153
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.600
- Just a tiny bite, come on.
- Madalena, Matilde...

154
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.080
- How is he, Rodrigo?
- Did the operation go well?

155
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.760
Very well.
He already has a new heart.

156
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.600
- So good!
- Thank God!

157
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.760
But he is at the recovery room
and will have to be there for a few hours.

158
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.760
- Why?
- A bad reaction to the anaesthesia.

159
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.040
He is feeling well, awake,
but can't say "half a serving".

160
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.040
- My God...
- Will he be like that forever?

161
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.240
Keep calm, let's have faith.
You know Eduardo is a warrior.

162
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.400
I'm sure he will be able
to say it again soon.

163
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.440
See you soon.

164
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.760
Thank you.

165
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.360
I still don't understand
why we're having lunch, Artur.

166
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.760
But you came anyway.

167
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080
Excuse me.

168
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.320
- The menu.
- Thank you.

169
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.600
- Do you want a 15 Euro water bottle?
- Yes, please bring us one.

170
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.400
Do you wish to explain
why we're having lunch?

171
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.680
- I believe you know, Cristina.
- Artur...

172
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.280
If it is about Blaze,
I already told you.

173
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.840
As CEO, I am not interested
in selling it.

174
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.080
Everything is for sale in this world.
Understand that, once and for all.

175
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.680
- Have you seen the menu?
- No.

176
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.160
What about the paintings?
That one is by Paula Rego.

177
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.760
- Give us a few minutes, will you?
- Sure.

178
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.200
Do you think they serve
a good rice risotto?

179
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
Let me choose.

180
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.720
Today, you're in my hands.

181
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.920
- Brings us foreign wine.
- Well, of course.

182
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.880
What's this?

183
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.200
Went outside and thought
of getting you a crab.

184
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.400
You're really something...

185
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.720
Will eat it in a bit, I'm just
working on the dark web. Let me...

186
00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.440
Dark web? I always
wanted to see how it is.

187
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.200
Looks like the Social Security site.

188
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.200
Yes, but it's dark.
You'll find everything here,

189
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.200
people selling weapons,
drugs, lamprey...

190
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.920
Why are you there?
Isn't it dangerous?

191
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.640
A little bit... But I use a fake profile,
"Official Ruy de Carvalho".

192
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.000
I can't do anything illegal.

193
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.600
When they give me extra change,
I get herpes here.

194
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.480
Where are you, Filipa's sister...

195
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.080
- Matilde!
- Hey!

196
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.720
So, how is your father?

197
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.240
- Did it all go well?
- Yes, thank God.

198
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.320
I mean...
He can't say "half a serving".

199
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.600
But doctors told us
he may be able to say it again.

200
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.640
Speech therapy.

201
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.560
My uncle couldn't say "6th floor
neighbour", after he got divorced.

202
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.600
He almost fully recovered.
Speech therapy...

203
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.600
Yeah...

204
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.560
He will be fine.

205
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.920
How will I know if he'll be fine?
I don't know him.

206
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.920
- And what's the problem with that?
- Are you crazy?

207
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.120
Have you imagined wasting food
your entire life?

208
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.400
- And the helplessness.
- You really don't have a heart...

209
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.520
Matilde... is there anything
I can do to help?

210
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.400
You can play my favourite song.

211
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.360
Come on, Lourenço.
Let's play her favourite song.

212
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.640
- Yeah...
- Let's go.

213
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.600
António...

214
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.000
I think of how you a woman would be
good for you so many times...

215
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.560
I'm used to it.

216
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.160
Can't remember how long it has been
since I've felt a woman's warmth.

217
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.920
- Since my Adília died.
- Such a stupid death, poor one.

218
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.840
- Trapped in a two door fridge.
- She had never seen one, you know?

219
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.080
Poor woman.
She was unlucky.

220
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.960
If only the head
had been on the outside...

221
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.560
But no, it had to get stuck
in the vegetable drawer!

222
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360
That's life.

223
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.400
Yes...

224
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.400
But come on,
tell me who do you think

225
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.200
will want me, with my age?

226
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.200
Don't say that, António.
One never knows.

227
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.240
- Tell me... come on!
- Open your eyes, António.

228
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.640
Since your Adília died,

229
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.680
you always had a woman
who loves you by your side.

230
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.160
Or... haven't you understood yet,
António?

231
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.840
Maria da Piedade, you...

232
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.080
- ... you... love me?
- More than you can imagine.

233
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.320
- I don't know what to say...
- You don't have to say a word.

234
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.200
I didn't tell you this...
to hear the same from you.

235
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.560
I know you don't feel the same.
I only told you this...

236
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.040
... because I drank four ginjinhas.

237
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.040
Maria da Piedade, I...

238
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.680
Forgive me... even if I wanted,
I wouldn't be able to lie to you.

239
00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.080
I have only ever loved
one woman.

240
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.640
- I need to talk with you, António.
- Excuse me.

241
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.680
Sunset
Sunset

242
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.880
Sunset

243
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.600
Sunset
Sunset

244
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.960
Sunset

245
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.600
Sunset

246
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.960
Sunset

247
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.360
Sunset

248
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.880
Sunset

249
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.960
It's impossible...

250
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.400
- Our daughter, Madalena?
- Our daughter, António!

251
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.520
She is alive. Alive!

252
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.040
It's impossible,
I saw her explode.

253
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.120
Her, the boat, the man...

254
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.600
She was wearing an asbestos onesie,
maybe it protected her.

255
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.880
- Asbestos?
- I had 20 years, how would I know?

256
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:08.680
- She's alive, that's what matters.
- She likes dolphins. Who doesn't?

257
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.760
What do we do now,
António?

258
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.200
Shall we talk with her?
Send her an SMS?

259
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.200
A funny meme
about parental neglect?

260
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.400
No, Madalena!
We won't do a thing.

261
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.040
Let's wait and think.

262
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.000
Does anyone else
know about this?

263
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.040
- No, nobody knows.
- No one saw the magazine?

264
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.960
Don't worry, António.

265
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.240
I already asked Father Vitó
to buy every copy of the magazine,

266
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.600
to burn them and hide the ashes
where no one goes. Moscavide.

267
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.400
Father Vitó...
You and that priest...

268
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.640
Are you sure he won't
tell this to anyone?

269
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.960
He won't, António! He can't!
It's forbidden, it was a confession.

270
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.640
I hope you're right, Madalena...
I really do.

271
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.800
- Want to talk, Pedro Granger?
- Yes, Crazy Tó.

272
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.720
We have a problem.

273
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.680
The work didn't go
as we had agreed.

274
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640
What do you mean?

275
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.320
I set the cherry trees on fire.

276
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.520
Yes, but only half got burnt.

277
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.040
You don't want to pay, dude?

278
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.640
- "Dude"?
- Yes, "dude".

279
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.720
If you're getting ideas,
I will tell the Police.

280
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.720
I recorded our conversation.

281
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.360
See this tooth here?

282
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.920
It's fake.

283
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.880
It had a recorder inside.

284
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.600
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

285
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680
Yes.

286
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.200
It will be interesting to see
if anyone finds out about that detail...

287
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.240
- ... in your autopsy.
- Autop...

288
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.520
I'm used to automatic cars.

289
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.640
Doctor Massacre?

290
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Yes.

291
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.040
- Stop! You're close enough.
- We have to scream, like this.

292
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.920
We have to scream!

293
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640
Enough!

294
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.120
Before we start,

295
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.640
would you mind answering a survey
with one or two questions?

296
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.280
- Right now?
- Yes, it won't take long.

297
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
- Have you hired a hitman before?
- Never.

298
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.360
- How did you get to me? Dark web?
- Muppies.

299
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.760
- Very good.
- And now?

300
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.760
Now... you'll give me
the picture of the target.

301
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.880
And after you transfer the bitcoins
to my account... I'll kill them.

302
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.720
- Will send you an ear to confirm.
- Jesus!

303
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.000
Do you prefer a nose?
Just don't request nails, I don't like it.

304
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.960
- I need to give you the picture!
- You don't use Airdrop?

305
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.880
WeTransfer?

306
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.080
One Drive?

307
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.880
One Direction?

308
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.720
Well, give me that.

309
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.000
Narciso?

310
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.800
Didn't you know you have a hitman
working at the farm?

311
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.200
Don't worry.

312
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.800
I will have much pleasure...

313
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.040
... in killing Dr. Simão.

314
