1
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
It has to be.
It has to be, Madalena.

2
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.400
We have to give away
one of our daughters.

3
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520
Why, António?

4
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.080
Because you're married
to engineer Eduardo.

5
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.119
If he finds out you had two kids,
he might divorce you and fire me.

6
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.600
But he doesn't know.

7
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.840
I hid this pregnancy.
I told him I was allergic to beans.

8
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.560
But he'll find out, eventually.
Take a look at the girls.

9
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.760
Look.

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.880
Look at them.
They look just like me.

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.680
Look at their beards.

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.920
- Let me keep one.
- No, it can't happen.

13
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.720
- Half of one?
- Don't insist.

14
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.920
Only I know how hard it is

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.400
to give one of my daughters to a man
that doesn't even have a car.

16
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.280
- What's that?
- I'm sorry.

17
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.640
No, I refuse.

18
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.360
I refuse to give up my girls.
Don't you understand, António?

19
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.680
Don't you understand?

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.400
These girls are a remembrance
of that night of love

21
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.200
in the windmill of Alcanhões.

22
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.320
Madalena, choose one, okay?

23
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.680
Choose one.

24
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.280
This one.

25
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.600
This one?

26
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.200
Are you sure?

27
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.400
Madalena, did you look at her nose?
Are you sure?

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.560
They look the same.
They're twins.

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.040
Alright.

30
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.560
Can we do this?
My brother-in-law will be on TV.

31
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560
You're right, but this is hard.

32
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.120
It's only the second time
I give away my kids.

33
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.400
This one is going.
Alright.

34
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
No! Wait.

35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.040
Let me give her something,
so she doesn't go like this.

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.440
Not the necklace, it's made of gold.

37
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680
Take this, my dear.

38
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.560
Take this pack of cigarettes.

39
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.920
There you go.
Let's go.

40
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.320
Don't worry.
We'll raise her like one of our own.

41
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.960
We've already bought
a Dulce Pontes onesie.

42
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.440
Thank you.
Come here.

43
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.120
Come here, don't cry.
Calm down.

44
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.760
We had no choice.

45
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.440
I promise to take good care of her.
Nothing bad will ever happen to her.

46
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.960
- No!
- Calm down.

47
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.960
Calm down, Madalena.

48
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.880
Calm down.

49
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.440
THIRTY YEARS LATER

50
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.000
Mum?

51
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.600
Good morning.

52
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.440
Mum, I'm going on a boat ride,
on the river.

53
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.480
What's up?

54
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.680
Nothing.

55
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.840
I was just thinking
about my life choices.

56
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.520
We've talked about that.

57
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.680
- They're not as big as you wanted...
- It's not that.

58
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.200
- I've done terrible things.
- Jesus.

59
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.160
It's almost like
you had two daughters,

60
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.120
gave one to a man with a boat
and the boat exploded.

61
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.880
Never say that again!

62
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.560
- What's going on here?
- Mum hit me.

63
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
Madalena!

64
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.400
I'm sorry.
It's the gin.

65
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.120
Gin?
But you don't even like gin.

66
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.640
Exactly.
Everyone does, except me.

67
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.880
It makes me upset.

68
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.079
- Sir?
- Yes, António?

69
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.880
The miss' birthday party
for tomorrow is ready.

70
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.400
Thank you.

71
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.440
My daughter.

72
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.640
Thirty years.

73
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.840
I remember when your mum brought you
in a basket, without cigarettes,

74
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.480
with her hair smelling like the river
and flames.

75
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.600
I don't understand how you thought
I was an allergy to beans.

76
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.080
It was a different time.
There was no Internet.

77
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.680
- Everyone knew Dulce Pontes.
- Shut up!

78
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.720
If I could, I would erase that day
from our history and from my memory.

79
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.920
Matilde!

80
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.640
Madalena!

81
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.840
Matilde!

82
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.960
Have you thought about it?

83
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.440
If our other daughter was alive,
she'd also turn thirty tomorrow.

84
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.480
Tomorrow, you turn thirty.

85
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.600
I don't even know if that's true.

86
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.360
That's what the letter that came
on the crib where they found me said.

87
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.440
If the letter said that...

88
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.720
The letter also said

89
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.280
that Dulce Pontes would be
the next Amália, and then...

90
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.880
You're the director of the biggest
Portuguese fashion magazine: Blaze.

91
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.920
It doesn't matter if you were found

92
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.680
on a burnt basket
with a pack of cigarettes and cherries.

93
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.800
I will not rest until I unveil
the secrets of my past.

94
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.760
Have you heard from New York?

95
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920
No.

96
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.680
But it's a matter of time.

97
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.760
The scientists
from the International Wicker Centre

98
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.560
are working to find out
where that basket came from.

99
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.920
I'm also searching on the Dark Web,
but you need to let this go, Filipa.

100
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.240
It's not easy.

101
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.480
The end of "Prós e Contras"
was also hard, but you'll get over it,

102
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.800
with either therapy
or Rodrigo Leão's music.

103
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.160
Miss...

104
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.200
I told you I don't like to be interrupted
when I'm standing.

105
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.600
Apologies.

106
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.120
Get out!

107
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.520
I hate women taller than me.

108
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.960
RTP and COYOTE VADIO
present

109
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.360
SUNSET
Love comes at Night

110
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.400
I'm tired of my mum

111
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.960
and the weight of being
a Bourbon de Linhaça.

112
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.640
When are we running away,
Lourenço?

113
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.440
And we'll survive with what?

114
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.520
I'm just an amateur musician,
the son of your housekeeper.

115
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.400
It doesn't matter.
Just tell me when.

116
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.400
I don't know.

117
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.960
First, we'd need a good pair
of running shoes,

118
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.520
a canteen, some cereal bars and...

119
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.560
We don't need any of that.

120
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.920
We have our love.

121
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.440
Choose a day,
so I can dream about it.

122
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.200
The 20th of August.

123
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.720
Good.

124
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.720
Of 2046.

125
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.200
With the money I make here...

126
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.720
Never mind that.

127
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.120
I'll steal
my family's diamond necklace.

128
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.080
The necklace of São Cajó?

129
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240
Yes.

130
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.760
No, Matilde.

131
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.120
No, that would be insane.

132
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.480
No.

133
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.920
That necklace has been
in the Bourbon de Linhaça family

134
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.320
for more than 3500 years.

135
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.000
So what? It's just a necklace.

136
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.840
Our future
is worth so much more.

137
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.520
No.

138
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.160
I...

139
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.080
I may be just a simple field worker
who has never played videogames,

140
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.960
but I have my honour.

141
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.080
Sunset

142
00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.840
Sunset

143
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.120
Sunset

144
00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.120
Sunset

145
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.920
Sunset
Sunset

146
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.760
Sunset

147
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.920
Sunset

148
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.680
Sunset

149
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.480
Sunset

150
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.400
- May I?
- Come in, Maria da Piedade.

151
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.600
- I'm just chopping some wood.
- In the living room?

152
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.640
I'm too old to chop wood outside,
you know?

153
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.120
Too many years
of sleeping naked.

154
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.800
The humidity got into my bones
and now my knees, they...

155
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.800
Don't say that, António.

156
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.200
You're still young.

157
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.960
Everyone else your age
wishes they had your energy to work.

158
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.560
It's the only thing I know how to do.

159
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.880
As you know,
I never went to school.

160
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.520
I had to start working
when I was very young,

161
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.320
on that damned coal mine.

162
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.880
- Your life was not easy.
- Not at all.

163
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.920
But thanks to my work,
I was able to feed the whole family.

164
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.640
It was enough for me,
for my parents, for my son

165
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.920
and for the Spanish woman
who made me tortillas in topless.

166
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.440
Well, António, I came to talk to you
because of your son, Lourenço.

167
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.800
Tell me, Maria da Piedade.
Don't scare me.

168
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.560
What's going on?

169
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.560
António...

170
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.640
Your son was outside
kissing the boss' daughter.

171
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.920
- What?
- Yes.

172
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.120
Calm down, António.

173
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.840
Watch out for your sinusitis.
Calm down.

174
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.280
I told him
that if he got involved with Matilde

175
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.480
I'd send him to the boy scouts.

176
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.440
And that's what I'll do.

177
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.400
Don't do that, please.
He's your son.

178
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.280
I'm going to do it, I don't care.
Where are the Yellow Pages?

179
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.760
António!

180
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.040
Good morning.

181
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.200
- Good morning, Zé Tó!
- Hey, how are you?

182
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.240
Hi, Joaquina!

183
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.800
Augusto!

184
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.560
- My name is Vitorino!
- It doesn't matter.

185
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.840
- How are you doing? Still breathing?
- Got a lot of work?

186
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.560
Always driving brits around.

187
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.120
It's 300 Euros
from here to the cathedral.

188
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.000
Stay here
and I'll buy you a drink later.

189
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.400
- Alright.
- Stay here.

190
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.400
- See you later.
- I'll pay you a drink.

191
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.960
Goodbye!

192
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.680
Elsa!

193
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.280
Your youngest kid is all snotty.

194
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.120
- How's it going, mum?
- I'm going insane.

195
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.000
That goddamn pension for tourists.
There's a lot of hairy brits.

196
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.920
It's not a pension, it's an hostel.

197
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.680
I'll tell them what an hostel is.

198
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.240
Look at that.

199
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.160
Hello, working class.

200
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.560
How's it going?

201
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.440
Zé Pinto,
did your daughter get that abortion?

202
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.720
You're getting better and better.
You're better than your daughter.

203
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.880
Tó Mané!

204
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.440
You can't even handle your own wife
and you're hitting on tourists?

205
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.680
Your stepfather is a bastard.
Always messing with the brits.

206
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.800
Elsa!

207
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.960
Your kid is smoking
cigarette butts from the floor.

208
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.320
Calm down.

209
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.560
Good afternoon, working class.
What's there to eat?

210
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.880
I'm singing at Adega do Zarolho,
later, and I need to eat.

211
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.160
With so many sparrows around,
I had to catch this canary.

212
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.800
Take this!

213
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.320
Take it!

214
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.120
As if she doesn't like it.

215
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.560
Unfortunately, Eduardo,
there's no cure for a heart sigh.

216
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.440
If it was a murmur...

217
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.840
But, in this case,
I'd say you have six months to live.

218
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.040
- Six months?
- Maybe seven,

219
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.880
if you replace red meat with olives
and avoid cars with leather seats.

220
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.560
Especially during the summer.

221
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.320
Why? Why me?

222
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.320
We all ask that.

223
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.920
No one knows the origin
of the heart sigh.

224
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.920
Some say it's genetic,
others say it was the Chinese

225
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.840
with this 5G thing,
no one knows.

226
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.080
My God.

227
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.360
The only thing we know
is that instead of pumping blood,

228
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.400
the heart pumps gas inside the body,
we start to inflate, we take off...

229
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.440
... and explode.

230
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.880
The only thing we can do
is to find a compatible donor.

231
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.400
Rodrigo, you've been my doctor
for more than 20 years,

232
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.560
ever since I put in the implants
to enlarge my buttocks.

233
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.920
Promise me that this conversation
will stay between us

234
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.640
and the Internet people.

235
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.400
I promise.

236
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.000
Don't worry, old friend.
And be strong.

237
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.240
Be strong.

238
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.760
My battery's running out...
Eduardo...

239
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.280
Eduardo...

240
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.920
Do you have anything
you want to tell me?

241
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.480
Get out!
Get out, Simão!

242
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.760
You don't have time
for your own brother?

243
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
Brother?

244
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.120
How can you call me brother
after all you've done?

245
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.720
What do you mean, Eduardo?

246
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.960
You don't have any proof
that I planted the bomb.

247
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.080
I know it was you who planted
the bomb on the winepress,

248
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.640
it was you who poisoned
the horses with tofu

249
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.280
and it was you who wrote my phone
number on the men's bathroom door

250
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.640
at the Aveiras motorway service area.
- You're not sure of that.

251
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.640
The only certainty
is that you took everything

252
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.920
the family Bourbon de Linhaça had.

253
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.160
The house, the estate, the necklace,

254
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.480
the corduroy robe
with the family coat of arms

255
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.160
that our father used to wear.

256
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.200
- And I...
- You?

257
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.880
- What did I get, Eduardo?
- You got the hatred!

258
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.400
You got the anger!

259
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.920
You could never do anything
for yourself.

260
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.840
The only thing I'll be able to do
for myself, Eduardo,

261
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.840
is to destroy you!

262
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.480
Destroy me?

263
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.960
If the mumps didn't get me,
it surely won't be you to get me, Simão.

264
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.280
And no matter how long it takes,
I will expose you.

265
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.040
Do you have enough time left
for all of that, Eduardo?

266
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600
Hello.

267
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.520
Hello.

268
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.680
This is not for you.

269
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.800
It's for my Testicle.

270
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.000
Hello!
How are you, Testicle?

271
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.840
How could you?

272
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.840
You swore.

273
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.359
You swore you wouldn't get involved
with miss Matilde.

274
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.760
You swore it!

275
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440
But, dad...

276
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.160
Lourenço, I asked you,
time and time again.

277
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.880
You can have whoever you want,
any woman in the world.

278
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.280
Cristina Ferreira, Fanny,
Ronaldo's mother,

279
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.720
but not with miss Matilde,
the boss' daughter.

280
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.080
But why?

281
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.480
Why, dad?

282
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.560
You've said it since I started
locking myself in the loo

283
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.640
with women's clothes magazines,
but you've never told me why.

284
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.680
You don't need to know.
You just need to obey your father.

285
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.200
Did I ever forbid you
from doing anything?

286
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.560
You can pierce your ears,

287
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.760
you can tattoo foreign names,

288
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.080
you can listen to D.A.M.A.
whenever you want,

289
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.960
but you can't get involved
with Matilde.

290
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.320
But I love her.

291
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.320
Shut up!

292
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.240
I can't wait to turn 35,
so I can be autonomous

293
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.640
and make my own decisions.

294
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.200
Smoke in the bedroom,
go to Madeira.

295
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.160
You're so ungrateful.

296
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.240
Have I asked anything of you?

297
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.400
Have I not given you anything?

298
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.720
I don't care about material things.
I want my freedom.

299
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.360
The freedom to love the only woman
who believes in my dream

300
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.400
of being the next António Zambujo.

301
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.680
That's right.

302
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.800
You and your big dreams.
Do you what your problem is?

303
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.080
You graduated sixth grade.
Now, you think you're important.

304
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.440
I don't want to end up like you:
alone, bitter

305
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.720
and a slave
to people who don't value you.

306
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.200
Lourenço, come back here.

307
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.640
Lourenço!

308
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.160
Don't do this to me.
Come here!

309
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.360
Eduardo, what's going on?

310
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.240
You're not well.
You're distant.

311
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.000
You know me well, Madalena.

312
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.280
We've been married
for more than 30 years.

313
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.920
Do you want to tell me what's up?
You making a dumb face.

314
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.080
Madalena, if I died today,

315
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.400
would you think
we have had a happy life?

316
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.520
Why are you asking that now?

317
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.560
Sometimes I wonder
if this makes sense, the estate...

318
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.400
... the million dollar horses,

319
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.400
the cherries,

320
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320
the helicopter...

321
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.520
The helicopter?

322
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.360
We don't have a helicopter.

323
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.480
Then what's that?

324
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.720
It's a cork tree, dear.

325
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.520
Damn.

326
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.960
My eyesight is getting worse.

327
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.120
Could the disease
be harming my eyesight?

328
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.280
- What disease?
- Madalena, are we happy?

329
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.920
Yes, except in bed.

330
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.760
Do you think I'm a good husband?

331
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.960
Yes, Eduardo, except in bed.

332
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.560
Am I that bad in bed, Madalena?

333
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.240
I do everything you ask.

334
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.560
I dressed up as a housekeeper
200 times this year.

335
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.880
Why so many questions, Eduardo?

336
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.520
It's nothing.
Continue painting.

337
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.960
Excuse me.

338
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.480
I've got some tea here.

339
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.720
And those quail cookies
you ordered from Spain.

340
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.320
Thank you, Maria da Piedade.
Leave it there.

341
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.400
And please validate my receipts
in the IRS website.

342
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.760
I've got over twenty.

343
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.240
Of course.

344
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.760
It's António.

345
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.080
António? What António?

346
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.680
Our António.

347
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.760
That's nonsense.

348
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.240
It's Zé Pedro,
from Xutos e Pontapés.

349
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.040
It's a tribute.

350
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.400
Madalena, care to explain
why you're painting António's face?

351
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.160
VANDA'S BAR

352
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.800
Stop!

353
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.120
Lourenço, what's going on?

354
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.120
You're too aggressive.
It's a bad vibe.

355
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.120
It's personal.

356
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.520
Tell us, we're a band.
We're very close.

357
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.160
It's personal.

358
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.840
Let him be, I also get like that
when I'm out of mobile data.

359
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.760
Let's take a break.

360
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.800
Jimmy.

361
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.720
Do you think he's like this
because of me?

362
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.960
Forget about it.
It was just one night.

363
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.840
He's moved on, okay?

364
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.760
Of course, I know.

365
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.120
I was just wondering
if it was worth buying a new helmet.

366
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.560
Diogo, didn't we agree
we'd have no drugs in the group?

367
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.720
Chill, man.
This is for my asthma.

368
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.600
I never liked the inhalers.

369
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.400
You're still looking for work, Jimmy?

370
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.720
Yes, anything.
It's really bad.

371
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.960
They want someone to take care
of the pigs in the estate.

372
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.800
You know I'm vegan.

373
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.800
Jimmy, you don't have to eat them.

374
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.440
It can't be.
It has to be a vegan job.

375
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.360
Something related to flip-flops,
braids or something like that.

376
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.040
There's no room for "but".

377
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.280
We're losing advertisers every week.

378
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.880
The shareholders want me to fire you.

379
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.400
But I don't know
what else to do, Cristina.

380
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.200
I've already put famous people naked
on the cover, myself included,

381
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.600
and my goddaughter too.

382
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.840
I'm the head of the board.
I don't care about your problems.

383
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.960
I answer to the shareholders.

384
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.240
My shrink says
this is not going well.

385
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.880
She's getting scolded again.

386
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.280
The way things are going,
you'll be the next one posing naked.

387
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400
Again?

388
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.600
My dad's already freaking out.
It was January, March...

389
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.880
March?

390
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.760
The Badoca Park
giraffe handler was you?

391
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.920
Cristina, I'm doing my best.

392
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.480
But I'm having
some personal problems.

393
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.680
I'm trying to investigate
some things from my past.

394
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.080
Cristina.

395
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.720
Something inside of me
tells me I'm not an orphan.

396
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.120
How so?

397
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.960
One look at you
and we know you're an orphan.

398
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.080
You have the face of an orphan,
the eyes, the teeth, the height...

399
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.800
I don't know.

400
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.360
I have a whole team of scientists
in New York investigating.

401
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.560
And Raul is searching the Dark Web
and the Sapo portal...

402
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.120
Filipa, I'm rich.

403
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.840
Rich people don't care about others.

404
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.960
If our next issue doesn't sell
78 million copies, you're fired.

405
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.600
And you'll get back to your old job
as a body pump instructor in Odivelas.

406
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.720
Madalena, don't run away
from my question.

407
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.520
Why were you painting António?

408
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.880
I paint whatever comes to my mind.
I'm an artist.

409
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.040
I've painted the pope,
Jorge Gabriel and Quaresma.

410
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.480
Don't bring up the artist thing.
I'm not uncultured.

411
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.680
I went to the theatre once.

412
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.480
You've never allowed me
to express my art.

413
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600
Never.

414
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.960
You've never allowed me to be myself

415
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.240
and go to Rock in Rio
wearing leggings.

416
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.520
- I'm tired of this!
- Calm down.

417
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.640
Calm down.

418
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.200
I know that sometimes
I may seem a bit conservative,

419
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.840
but you must understand I was raised
among the animals and the cherries.

420
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.760
When we only had one TV channel.

421
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.000
I've always voted
for the Christian party.

422
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.560
You've studied agronomy in London.

423
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.320
When there was rock, punks and drugs.

424
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.920
How come you didn't expand
your horizons?

425
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.560
Because I got bullied
for parting my hair in the middle.

426
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.920
I'm suffocating in this relationship.

427
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.040
I need to run freely.

428
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.440
- Free like Obikwelu.
- Madalena, listen to me.

429
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.560
You're right.

430
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.320
You're absolutely right.

431
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.680
I promise I'll make you happy.

432
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.240
I...

433
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.280
At least in these last few months.

434
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.120
In these last few months?

435
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.200
What are you hiding from me?

436
00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.680
Lourenço.

437
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440
May I?

438
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.800
Come in, Mr. Simão.
Do you want some?

439
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.880
I've made some fish sticks

440
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.360
that only take two minutes
to cook in the microwave

441
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.120
and that are sold
in all supermarkets.

442
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.600
They're fresh, easy to cook

443
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.840
and they have all the ingredients
for a healthy and nutritive meal.

444
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040
Want some?

445
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.880
Each package feeds four people
and only costs 8,99 Euros.

446
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.080
No, thank you, Lourenço, but...

447
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.520
So, Mr. Simão, why are you here?

448
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.440
Lourenço...

449
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.400
You can see it was caught
and frozen in the open sea.

450
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.680
Lourenço.

451
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.760
What I'm about to propose to you...

452
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.120
You have to promise
it stays between us.

453
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.080
Tell me, Mr. Simão.
You know you can trust me.

454
00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.760
If you tell this to someone,
I'll say it's a lie

455
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.920
and I'll block you on social media.

456
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.360
Tell me.

457
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.720
You may speak freely.

458
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.200
Lourenço,
I'll give you one million Euros

459
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.920
and a leather jacket
I don't wear anymore

460
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.760
if you convince the estate workers
to rebel against my brother.

461
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.120
One million Euros?

462
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.120
It would be enough to run away
with my star-crossed lover to Silves.

463
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.360
And a jacket.

464
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.400
One million Euros and a jacket.

465
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.760
One million Euros.

466
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.920
I don't care.

467
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.760
The next issue must sell
78 million copies,

468
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.040
so you better get Júlio Isidro
to pose naked for the cover.

469
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.040
- Should I put these papers here?
- Yes.

470
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.080
Do you think they belong here,
you idiot?

471
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.960
- You told me...
- Shut up!

472
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.360
Go serve some coffee,
buy printer ink or whatever it is you do.

473
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.760
- I'm your assistant.
- Shut up!

474
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.000
Who's calling me at this hour?

475
00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.680
